1. **Low Demand Detection**
   ```python

     - Users with high app engagement
     - Users near low-demand areas

3. **Price Comparison**
   ```python
   if ai_optimized_price < base_price * 0.85:
       eligible_for_notification = True
   ```

4. **Notification Dispatch**
   ```
   Smart Notification Engine â†’ Firebase Cloud Messaging â†’ Mobile Apps
   ```
