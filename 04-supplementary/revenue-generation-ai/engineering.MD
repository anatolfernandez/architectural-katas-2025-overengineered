## Performance Considerations

### Latency Targets
- Vehicle availability + pricing: < 200ms (p95)
- Risk score lookup (cached): < 10ms
- Risk score calculation (fresh): < 100ms
- Surge grid update: < 30 seconds propagation

### Caching Strategy
- **Feature Store (Redis)**:
  - Customer risk scores: 24-hour TTL
  - Surge grid: 15-minute TTL
  - Event data: 1-hour TTL

- **API Level Caching**:
  - Price calculations: 1-minute TTL with user_id + location key
  - Vehicle availability: 30-second TTL

### Scalability
- **Stream Processing**: Handles 100k telemetry events/second
- **Web Scraping**: Distributed across 10 workers
- **ML Inference**: Auto-scales 2-20 instances based on load
- **Feature Store**: Redis cluster with 3 replicas

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **SLA Monitoring**:
  - Price calculation latency > 500ms
  - Model inference failures > 1%
  - Cache hit rate < 80%

- **Business Metrics**:
  - Surge pricing activation rate
  - Risk-adjusted pricing impact on revenue
  - Notification conversion rates
  - Customer complaints about pricing

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
1. If Risk Assessment AI fails → Use last known score or default multiplier (1.0x)
2. If Event Detection fails → Use historical surge patterns
3. If Feature Store is down → Direct database queries with higher latency
4. If ML Platform is down → Use cached model versions locally

### Circuit Breakers
- Implemented for all external service calls
- Fallback to cached or default values
- Alert ops team for manual intervention

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- PII encryption at rest and in transit
- Telemetry data anonymized after 90 days
- GDPR compliance for EU customers

### Rate Limiting
- Per-user API rate limits: 100 requests/minute
- Surge pricing updates throttled to prevent gaming
- Notification frequency capped at 3/day per user
